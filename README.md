# credit card math
Two recursive functions for calculating credit card debt:
- *calc_balance()* calculates the credit card balance after X months for a person who only pays the minimum monthly payment and builds a list of monthly payments.
- *pay_off_dept()* calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order to pay off a credit card balance within X months using bisection search.

The user must set the values for the variables *initial balance* ('balance'), *duration* ('months'), *annual interest rate* ('aIR'), and *monthly payment rate* ('mPR') directly in the code.
